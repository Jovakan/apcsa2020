# Unit 4: Iteration
This unit introduces the idea of iteration, repeating a process until certain conditions are met. This unit focuses on while and for loops to create algorithms for Strings and numbers. Unit 4 also contains the first College Board lab assignment. 

## Duration
 * 3 Weeks

## Unit Topics
 * Algorithms for numbers and Strings
 * While, for and nested loops
## Lessons
 * [Unit 4: Lesson 1 - While Loops:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit4/lesson1) In this lesson, students are introduced to the use of while loops to repeat program code (CON).
 * [Unit 4: Lesson 1 1/2 - Tracing Code:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit4/lesson1.5) This lesson demonstrates how the results of code segments containing iterative statements can be determined by using a trace table (CON).
 * [Unit 4: Lesson 2 - Algorithms for Numbers:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit4/lesson2) This lesson introduces standard algorithms which students can code, modify and develop using loops (CON).
 * [Unit 4: Lesson 3 - The For Loop:](https://github.com/mapoztate/apcsa2020/tree/master/unit4/lesson3) This lesson introduces the for loop, an alternative loop syntax used to repeat code (CON).
 * Unit 4: Lesson 4 - Algorithms for Strings: This lesson focuses on the creation, implementation and modification of algorithms which use String traversals (CON).
 * Unit 4: Lesson 5 - Nested Loops: In this lesson, the way in which nested iteration statements can be used is examined (CON).
 * Unit 4: Lesson 6 - Algorithm Efficiency: This lesson introduces the concept of algorithmic efficiency through the use of statement execution counts (CON).

**This unit’s lessons include the following activities that reinforce the course’s computational thinking practices:**
 * Students will explain why a given code segment will not run as intended (Skill 5.B).
 * Students will explain what is calculated by a given code segment (Skill 5.A).
 * Students will complete missing code in a loop header (Skill 1.B).
 * Students will use both selection and iteration to produce a desired output when the main method of a program executes (Skill 3.C).
 * Students will explain the results of running a code segment (Skill 5.A).
 * Students will determine the results of running a code segment with nested iteration statements (Skill 2.B).
 * Students will write nested iteration statements to produce a desired output (Skill 3.C).

## Assignment
 * Assignment 4: String Shortener: Students will design a program which processes a String, determines properties of this String and prints a modified version of the String (Skill 1.A). Students must write iteration statements, decision statements, and String methods to implement this program (Skill 2.B).

## Assessments and Labs
 * Unit 4 Quiz
 * Unit 4 Exam
 * Lab: Consumer Review
