# Unit 3 - Boolean Expressions and If Statements

This unit introduces the concepts that programs use to make decisions using the logic of Boolean expressions, If and Else statements.

## Duration
 * 3 Weeks

## Unit Topics
 * If and else statements
 * Booleans and truth tables
 * Short circuit evaluation and De Morgan’s law
 * Comparing objects

## Lessons
 * Unit 3: Lesson 1 - Simple Ifs: In this lesson, students are shown how to use if statements to introduce conditional logic to their program (CON).
 * Unit 3: Lesson 2 - Ifs - Making Decisions: This lesson introduces more comparison operators which can be used in if statements with primitive values (CON).
 * Unit 3: Lesson 3 – Else: This lesson introduces the else and else if statements to give students greater control over the flow of their programs (CON).
 * Unit 3: Lesson 4 - Booleans and Truth Tables: This lesson introduces the use of Boolean operators to create compound Boolean statements (CON).
 * Unit 3: Lesson 5 - Short Circuit Evaluation: This lesson explains how short-circuit evaluation is used by Java when evaluating Boolean statements (CON).
 * Unit 3: Lesson 6 - De Morgan's Law: In this lesson students learn how to apply De Morgan’s law to find equivalent Boolean statements (CON).
 * Unit 3: Lesson 7 - Comparing Objects: This lesson explains how to compare object data in Java using both the ‘==’ operator and the equals method (CON).
 
 **This unit’s lessons include the following activities that reinforce the course’s computational thinking practices:**
 * Students will identify an error in a short segment of code (Skill 4.B).
 * Students will identify which code segments from a selection are equivalent (Skill 4.C).
 * Students will complete a partially completed code segment (Skill 1.B).
 * Students will write code with multiple conditional statements to produce a desired output (Skill 3.C).
 * Students will describe the details of how a particular statement will be evaluated in a Java program (Skill 5.A).
 * Students will identify equivalent Boolean statements (Skill 4.C).
 * Students will evaluate the output from a code segment containing multiple conditionals (Skill 2.B). Assignment
 * Assignment 3 - Crack the Code!: Students will write nested decision statements to control the flow of a program, determining which conditions are checked at which points in the program to produce the correct output (Skill 2.B).
